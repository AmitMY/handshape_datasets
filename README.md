# handshape_datasets
A single library to load all sign language handshape datasets.

[handshape](http://facundoq.github.io/unlp/lsa16/files/dataset/1_1_1.png) [handshape](http://facundoq.github.io/unlp/lsa16/files/dataset/2_1_1.png)

There are [various handshape datasets](http://facundoq.github.io/unlp/sign_language_datasets/) for Sign Language. 
However, each has its own mapping of handshapes to classes. 
While Signs depend on the specific Sign Language for a country/region, handshapes are universal.
Hence, they could be shared between datasets/tasks. This library provides two main features:
* A simplified API to download and load handshape datasets
* A mapping between datasets so that datasets can be merged for training/testing models.

We hope it will help Sign Language Recognition develop further, both in the research and application domains.

If you wish to add a dataset you can make a push request, file an issue, or write to handshape.datasets@at@gmail.

This library is a *work in progress*. Contributions are welcome.
